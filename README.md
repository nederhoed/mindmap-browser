mindmap-browser
===============

A mindmap browser loosely based on Topic Map theory. A mindmap is just one view on some knowledge. What you would want is a web of mindmaps, based on the underlying knowledge.

To realise this, we separate knowledge and visualization. We model the knowledge using a system based on Topic Map theory. Then we browse through the knowledge using a dynamic visualization of parts of the knowledge.

Topic Maps theory offers 3 types of information: Topics, Associations and Occurences. We define knowledge in these terms.

## An example: The Simpson family
Let's model a family and visualize some possible mindmaps for this family. To keep it simple, we will start with Marge, Homer, Bart and Lisa.

Topics: Marge, Homer, Bart, Lisa, Saxophone
Associations: 
* "Marge is married to Homer"
* "Bart is Lisa's brother"
* "Marge is Lisa's parent"
* "Lisa plays Saxophone"
Occurences:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFoW6fa79xA (Lisa playing Saxophone)

Topic types: "cartoon character"
Association types: "married to", "plays instrument", "is parent of"
Occurence types: "video"
